## A version to be improved from the basic robomongo
Okay, so hear me out, the basic Robo 3T do not have many good features that it could have had. I know studio 3T does, then that is not really free, so I am starting this fork to add all those extra features offered by Studio 3T and leave them available for the Open Source community to use. 

## This Readme still needs an update, so don't judge it for now!

## Mongo Developer Roadmap:
* Copy collections between two database connections
* UI upgrades and revamp
* Export collection in various formats like CSV, XLSX, and other tabular formats.
* SQL Query support
* SSH / SSL Tunnels based connection support
* Query Profiler tool for optimizing query performance
* More to be added
